# Ultrasonic Avoidance Car with MicroBit and Keyestudio

**Description:**

This project integrates an ultrasonic sensor with a car to create an ultrasonic avoidance car. The principle behind this project is to utilize the ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance between the car and obstacles, enabling the smart car to adjust its motion accordingly to avoid collisions.

**Preparation:**

1. Insert the micro:bit board into the slot of the Keyestudio 4WD Mecanum Robot Car V2.0.
2. Place batteries into the battery holder.
3. Dial the power switch to the ON position.
4. Connect the micro:bit to your computer via a USB cable.
5. Open the Web version of Makecode.
6. Import the Hex profile (or create a new project and add blocks step by step, including the MecanumRobot extension library).


**Test Code:**

You can find the test code in the following path:

- File Type: Hex file
- Path: ../2. Makecode Tutorial/Makecode Code Project 18.2
- File Name: Ultrasonic Avoidance Car.hex

Alternatively, you can edit the code step by step in the editing area of the Makecode platform.

Let's build and experiment with the Ultrasonic Avoidance Car using MicroBit and Keyestudio components! Enjoy exploring the world of robotics and automation!
